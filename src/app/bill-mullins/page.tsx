          <p>William was born around 1799 and he married Bridget Kelly some time before 1833.  Together, they had at least five children:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>- William (1833 -)</li>
            <li>- James (1835 -)</li>
            <li>- Timothy William (1837 - 1896)</li>
            <li>- Joseph (1843 -)</li>
            <li>- Mary Anne (1844 - 1895)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some time between the 1850s and the mid-1860s, William Maxey fell on hard times.  When his son, Joseph, was imprisoned in 1866-67, pleas for his release were made on the basis that his family had fallen into destitution, including his father William, who was dependent upon him.</p>

          <p>Whilst these pleas fell upon deaf ears, William passed away in the workhouse in Clonmel at the age of 67 from a bladder infection.  Bridget outlived Wililam.  However, it is known when she died.</p>
